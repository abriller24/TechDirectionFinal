# Maya Lego Block Creator

## Introduction:
This is a tool I built using python with the help of @Studio 4 Media help on youtube. He explained the concept of building the base structure of the lego building block within python for maya and I expounded on the idea. I added on the ability to change the height as well as the color of the lego block itself. 

##Install:
* download and unzip the plugin, it should look like this when unzipped correctly
* open the final folder to find the python script needed. Drag and drop this into maya
